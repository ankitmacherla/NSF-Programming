		<h2> Web Application Types </h2>
		<p> An web application is a program that runs in a web browser. Some web apps include webmail,
			online messaging, and a calculator.
			<br> We studied four types of web apps: </p>
		<ul>
			<li> Packaged Apps. These are apps that don't require any outside resources,
				including internet or files that weren't initially downloaded. </li>
			<li> Hosted Apps. These are apps that have all resources on a web server. This includes
				HTML, CSS, JavaScript, the native programming language, and other app information. </li>
			<li> Installable Web Apps. These are apps that store some resources locally on your device, but the
				rest of the information is stored online. </li>
			<li> Hybrid Apps. These are apps that use the device's native web client to access internet but also utilizes HTML, CSS,
			 	and JS. </li>
		</ul>

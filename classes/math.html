		<h2> Math </h2>
		<p> In math, we have four main operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. With code, there are five:</p>
		<ol>
			<li> Addition. We use "+" in code, like we do in math. <br> Note: This extends beyond just numbers. You can name two variables
					add them together, or you can add strings like so: "Hello" + " " + "World!" = "Hello World!". Addition is the ONLY mathematical
					operation that can be done on strings.  </li>
			<li> Subtraction. We use "-". </li>
			<li> Multiplication. "*".  </li>
			<li> Division. "/". </li>
			<li> Remainder or Modulus ("%"). This operation checks the remainder when the first number is divided by the second. So, 24 % 5 = 4
				and 25 % 5 = 0. This is especially helpful for checking odd and even numbers (n % 2 == 0 or n % 2 == 1). </li>
		</ol>
		If you want to say, for variable x, that we want to add n to x, we can write: x += n instead of x = x + n. We can also use:
		<ul>
			<li> x -= n for subtraction </li>
			<li> x *= n for multiplication </li>
			<li> x /= n for division </li>
			<li> x %= n for remainder/modulus </li>
		</ul>
		<p> We can also use x++ or x-- for x += 1 and x -= 1. </p>
		<h3> Exercises </h3>
			<ul>
				<li> Write a function that checks if a number is prime. </li>
				<li> Write a function that concatenates strings. </li>
			</ul>
